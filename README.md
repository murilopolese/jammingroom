# Jamming Room

If you don't have any habilities with instruments, how many times have you
been hanging with your friends while they play and what's left for you is a
shaker or even claping your hands during the chorus? 

## The hipotesis

Jamming Room is a trial of a hipotesis that you can build music structures
where people with different levels of musicality can interact more equaly.

It can be used by yourself, playing with melody generators, or with your friends.

## How it works?

You create a room and define a chord progression. After this you will have an
endpoint where you can fetch the chords and a default scale.

The main goal is to have an ecossystem of instruments that can join this room
and fetch this information to create different experiences on m√∫sic. It can be
an instrument like our Very Beginner or something more advanced like our
Reich.

## Gamification

Music is also challenging. To add this to our experience we added a score system
where you earn points by following a suggested melody. You can totally skip this
even I recommend you to start by gamming and than making an 17 minutes killer
solo with our **amazing** instruments.

## To come

We wish we could play with a undefined number of instruments and it still sounds cool.
Would be awesome also to be able to fetch chord progressions from top hits and
create jams around already known melodies. All this is to come and we'd love to
have you jamming with us soon!
